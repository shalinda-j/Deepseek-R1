# How to Run the DeepSeek R1 Model on Your Own Server Using Google Colab

Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning have revolutionized various industries, and open-source models like **DeepSeek R1** are making it easier for developers to implement advanced AI functionalities. If you are looking to run the DeepSeek R1 model on your own server using **Google Colab**, this guide will walk you through the process step by step.

## Why Use Google Colab?
Google Colab provides an interactive environment where you can run Python scripts and execute AI models without requiring high-end hardware. It supports cloud computing, making it an excellent choice for AI development and testing.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Running DeepSeek R1 on Your Server

### Step 1: Create a Folder in Google Drive
Before starting with Google Colab, you need to create a dedicated folder in **Google Drive**. This will help you manage files efficiently.

1. Open **Google Drive**.
2. Click on **New** and select **Folder**.
3. Give your folder a meaningful name, such as "DeepSeek_Project".

### Step 2: Set Up a Google Colab Project
Once your folder is ready, proceed with setting up a **Google Colab** project.

1. Open the newly created folder.
2. Right-click inside the folder and navigate to the **More** tab.
3. Click on **Google Colab** to create a new Colab notebook.

### Step 3: Install Required Dependencies
Now, open the Colab notebook and paste the following commands to install essential packages:

```sh
!pip install langchain  
!pip install langchain-core  
!pip install langchain-community  
```

These installations will set up the necessary libraries required for integrating and running the DeepSeek R1 model.

### Step 4: Enable Colab Terminal Access
To execute shell commands, you need to enable the **Colab xTerm** extension. Run the following commands:

```sh
!pip install colab-xterm  
%load_ext colabxterm  
%xterm  
```

This will allow you to open a terminal inside Google Colab, enabling seamless interaction with the system.

### Step 5: Install and Run Ollama for DeepSeek R1
DeepSeek R1 requires **Ollama**, a framework that simplifies AI model deployment. Install and run Ollama using:

```sh
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh  

ollama serve & ollama run deepseek-r1:7b  
```

Once the installation is complete, the **DeepSeek R1 model** will be successfully deployed and ready to use on your server.

## Conclusion
By following these steps, you can easily run the **DeepSeek R1 model** on your own server using **Google Colab**. This setup allows you to experiment with AI-powered applications without requiring expensive hardware. Whether youâ€™re a researcher, developer, or AI enthusiast, this guide provides an efficient way to deploy **DeepSeek R1** with minimal setup time.
